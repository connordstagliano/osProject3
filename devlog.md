# osProject3 Dev Log
## 12/6/24 11:13am START
  This is the first devlog, I am beginning the project for the first time. I expect to use most of today and tomorrow, and possibily the morning of sunday the 8th to complete work.
  The apporach I am planning is to create the menu functionality first, and implement features in order of dependancies. That is, I will implment the create, open, and quit features
  first, as they are necessary for completion of the other features. I will then implement insert and print, to ensure the index file functions correctly, and then finally i will
  implement any other outstanding features.

## 12/6/2024 1:22pm FIRST MAJOR COMMITT
  First commit made. Program successfully has menu functionality, creates/overwrites files upon request, and can open an existing idx file. Next is to add the creation of file headers, and
  then I will begin to implement the B tree operations.

## 12/7/2024 12:08pm SECOND SESSION BEGIN
  Beginning my second session. I committed some small changes I made before I got off last session. I am planning on finishing the project today, as writing and accessing the file has been
  a bit smoother than I initially anticipated. If I am able to get the insertions into the B-Tree correct, then I don't expect there to be too many other difficulties.
