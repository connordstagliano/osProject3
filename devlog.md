# osProject3 Dev Log
## 12/6/24 11:13am
  This is the first devlog, I am beginning the project for the first time. I expect to use most of today and tomorrow, and possibily the morning of sunday the 8th to complete work.
  The apporach I am planning is to create the menu functionality first, and implement features in order of dependancies. That is, I will implment the create, open, and quit features
  first, as they are necessary for completion of the other features. I will then implement insert and print, to ensure the index file functions correctly, and then finally i will
  implement any other outstanding features.
