The repo contains two java classes, Menu.java and IndexManager.java
Menu.java is the driver class, containing the main method. This is what must be executed for the program to run.
Obivoulsy both files need to be in the same directory, as well as any .idx or .txt files used in the operations.
All files use standard I/O, and Menu.java can be ran from the command line in the common way.
